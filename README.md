The story behind this cl*sterf*ck:

Initially, and without much guidance, I decided to learn how to "think like a programmer" with something that didn't seem very cryptic and easily accessible in Windows OS.
Batch Scripting.
That was my first mistake lol.

Some would argue that there are better first languages, and I would agree. 
But this script helped me learn and understand Functions, Variables, Strings, Etc. at a basic level.
Now I only add new functionalities when it helps me automate or shortcut something I do frequently or just piques my interest lmao


I am in NO WAY claiming that this is how things should or shouldn't be done. I also do not guarantee correct/any functionality on your system.
If I post a new version, I know that it works as intended on my machine.

 
It started as an Anti-Bloatware script and over time I just kept implementing new and what I thought were progmatically interesting functions trying to figure out how I could do it a little better next time
Soon after, I decided to add something that vaguely resembeled a User-Interface lol. While bulky and not exactly maintainable, it serves its purpose

I've went back over it a few seperate times as my understanding and skill level improved. The script does what it says it does, but it could probably be done in a better fashion
